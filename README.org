* Summary
  This is a toy model for regular expression.

* How it works
  These classes construct regular expression using a very simple way.

** Formal definition for regular language
   - any single letter, empty string $\epsilon$, $\emptyset$ are regular language.
   - The *kleene Closure* of any regular language is regular language.
   - The *Union* of any regular language is regular language.
   - The *ConCat* of any regular language is regular language.

** How to implement a finite automata to recognize the regular expression.
*** Using NFA to simulate the union of the regular language
	[[./img/union.png]]
*** Using NFA to simulate the concat of the regular language
	[[./img/concat.png]]
*** Using NFA to simulate the kleene closure of the regular language
	[[./img/kleene.png]]

  After the steps above, we just need to implement a bfs to convert the NFA to DFA.
